# AmazingUWPToolkit

A number of small helpers, behaviors, etc. to help you create UWP application with ease. From most known like `BooleanToVisibilityConverter` to something more specific like `ApplicationViewHelper`.

It's designed to be a set of small tools brought together. So you can get only what you actually want.

Currently it's under kinda active development. I will update README after each new feature will be implemented. 

## [ApplicationViewHelper](https://github.com/khamitimur/AmazingUWPToolkit/tree/master/AmazingUWPToolkit.ApplicatonView)

Can help you to take control of a [`CoreApplicationViewTitleBar`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.coreapplicationviewtitlebar) and a [`ApplicationViewTitleBar`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.applicationviewtitlebar) in a scenario when you have your collection of brushes for a `TitleBar` defined as `ThemeResource`'s and you want them to change along UI theme color.
